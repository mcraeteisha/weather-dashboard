## User Story
As a develop who writes about tech
* I want a CMS-style blog site where I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS / Materialize
* JavaScript
* Local Storage
* OpenWeather API
 
## Work Completed

Using VS Code, the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), Materialize, and GitHub, I completed the following:

* Created a Weather Dashboard UI using HTML, CSS, and Materialize CSS.
* Fetched data from the OpenWeather API.
* Displayed data from the OpenWeather API to the page upon search.
* Used Local Storage to save previous search data.
 
## Learnings and Issues
Some of the learnings I'm taking away from this project are:
1. The biggest issue I had with this project was getting the weather icon image to display to the page. I was able to successfully pull the image from the API data and create an image URL for it (I logged the image URL to the console and was sent to the correct image upon clicking). However, I was unable to get it to render to the page.
2. Unfortunately, the UV Index API had been deprecated when I completed this project, so I was not able to add that feature to my weather information. 

## Future Application Updates
* Add the weather icon image to weather information. 
* Make UI more sleek and responsive.
